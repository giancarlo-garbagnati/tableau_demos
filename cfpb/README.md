# Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Consumer Complaint Dashboard  

Dashboard link

This dashboard displays some information regarding the complaints filed with the CFPB from its beginning in late 2011 to Feb 20, 2025. It covers the kinds of complaints filed, to whom (which companies) they're filed against, and when and where the complaints are filed from.  
  
The [CFPB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) is an independent agency of the United States that monitors and helps police financial institutions and (notably for this project) collects consumer complaints towards these institutions. It creation (authorized as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as part of a legislative reaction to the 2008 financial crisis. It will most likely cease most of its operations by Q2 of 2025.

## To Do List  
1. Write a script to update the data (pull from CFPB website and process). As far as I know, I'd have to manually update the Tableau dashboard itself. I could theoretically get Tableau to automatically update if I use a Google Sheet instead of just a .csv. However, since the processed dataset (up to 2/20) is 1.7gb, I don't think I'll use up my precious Google space with this. The other "blocker" could be that the CFPB just stops existing (or stops updating and/or taking any complaints) rendering any update script kind of moot.
2. Format the dashboard for mobile use.
