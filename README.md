Demo dashboards on Tableau Public

A place to store any of my demo dashboards made in Tableau along with any associated information or processing code.

covid_demo - A dashboard made using US COVID case and death data by state, along with demographic (age/sex/ethnicity) rates, through the height of the COVID pandemic (early 2020-mid 2023).

sleepdep_demo - A (partially built) dashboard using a sleep deprivation study dataset* to look at how certain cognitive performance, emotional regulation, lifestyle factors, daytime sleepiness, lifestyle factors, hours slept, and sleep quality interact* with each other. (* Many caveats come with this as the dataset seems too small and noisy to really pull out many meaningful insights).
